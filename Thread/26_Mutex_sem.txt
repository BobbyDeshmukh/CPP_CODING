1. Binary Semaphore

A binary semaphore is a semaphore that can have only two values: 0 or 1.

-> Used for signaling between threads/processes.
-> No ownership – any thread can signal (post) it.
-> Can be used for task synchronization.
-> May not support priority inheritance (depends on OS).

2. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock)

A mutex is specifically designed for mutual exclusion.

-> Used to protect critical sections.
-> Ownership exists – only the thread that locks it can unlock it.
-> Prevents race conditions.
-> Often supports priority inheritance (to prevent priority inversion).
